## 🚀 Release Notes

**This is the most stable version based on my own testing.**

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please report them via the email address listed in the app's Help section.

### 🔧 Easy Installation with Batch Files

**For your convenience, I've included batch files:**

- **`run.bat`** - Automatically installs dependencies and starts the application
  - Checks if Python is installed
  - Installs missing libraries (requests, beautifulsoup4, psutil, Pillow)
  - Validates all files are present
  - Starts the application with error handling

- **`uninstall.bat`** - Safely removes all libraries when done
  - Shows which libraries will be removed
  - Asks for confirmation before proceeding
  - Preserves Python installation (only removes libraries)
  - Provides clear feedback for each operation

### 🛡️ Antivirus Note

Some antivirus programs may flag this tool as suspicious due to its internet access and ability to read/write files on your hard drive. This is a very common false positive for open-source download utilities — the program is clean and fully open source.

To avoid interruptions, I recommend:
• Temporarily disabling your antivirus while using the tool, or
• Adding an exception for the executable in both your antivirus and Windows Defender Firewall.

### 🔧 If the .exe gets blocked or deleted by your antivirus:

You can run the tool without the executable:
1. Download all the Python files from the repository
2. Install Python (if you don't have it already) — https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Double-click `run.bat` to install dependencies and start

Enjoy! If you find the tool helpful, please consider supporting the project — every bit of support helps keep it updated and improved.
